## Hello!

I'm Justin. Professionally I'm a Senior DevOps Engineer
with @Ylopo. I've worked as a coach helping deliver teams learn and have played heavily in the CICD and Cloud spaces for a few years
now. 

I've been spending a lot of my time within GitHub, AWS, and the security spaces working on delivering apps.
