## What's up everybody

I'm Justin. I'm a people person who likes to computer every now and again. Professionally I'm a Senior DevOps Engineer
with @Ylopo. I've worked as a coach in the Dojo and have played heavily in the CICD and Cloud spaces for a few years
now. I've been working a lot with Azure and GitHub lately and am excited to see the work they're doing there. 

Personally? Just trying to help make the world a better place while enjoying some tacos and music at the beach. Say hey!
